            <h2>Lata Mangeshkar</h2>
            Lata Mangeshkar ([ləˈtaː məŋˈɡeːʃkər] (audio speaker iconlisten)) (born as Hema Mangeshkar; 28 September 1929 – 6 February 2022) was an Indian playback singer and occasional music composer. She is widely considered as one of the greatest and most influential singers in India.[6][7] Her contribution to Indian music industry in a career spanning seven decades gained her honorific titles such as the Nightingale of India, Voice of the Millennium and Queen of Melody.[8]

She recorded songs in over thirty-six Indian languages and a few foreign languages, though primarily in Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi.[8] She received several accolades and honors throughout her career. In 1989 the Dadasaheb Phalke Award was bestowed on her by the Government of India.[9] In 2001, in recognition of her contributions to the nation, she was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour; she is only the second female singer, after M. S. Subbulakshmi, to receive this honour.[10] France conferred on her its highest civilian award, Officer of the National Order of the Legion of Honour, in 2007.[11]

She was the recipient of three National Film Awards, 15 Bengal Film Journalists' Association Awards, four Filmfare Best Female Playback Awards, two Filmfare Special Awards, the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award and many more. In 1974, she was one of the first Indian playback singers to ever perform at Royal Albert Hall, London.

Mangeshkar was born in a Maharashtrian Brahmin family[12] in 1929, the eldest daughter of Deenanath Mangeshkar, a Marathi and Konkani musician, and his wife Shevanti[13] in Indore (in present-day Madhya Pradesh and then the capital of the princely state of Indore which was part of the Central India Agency in British India). Her father, Deenanath Mangeshkar, was a classical singer and theatre actor. Her mother, Shevanti (later renamed Shudhamati), a Gujarati woman from Thalner, Bombay Presidency (now in northwest Maharashtra), was Deenanath's second wife; his first wife Narmada, who had died, was Shevanti's older sister.[14]

Her paternal grandfather, Ganesh Bhatt Navathe Hardikar (Abhisheki), was a priest who performed the abhishekam of the Shiva lingam at the Mangueshi Temple in Goa.[15] Her paternal grandmother, Yesubai Rane, was from Goa. Her maternal grandfather, Seth Haridas Ramdas Lad, was from Gujarat, a prosperous businessman and landlord of Thalner. She learned Gujarati folk songs such as garbas of Pavagadh from her maternal grandmother.[16]

Deenanath adopted the surname Mangeshkar in order to identify his family with his native town of Mangeshi, Goa. Lata was named "Hema" at her birth. Her parents later renamed her Lata after a female character, Latika, in one of her father's plays, भाव बंधन.[17]

She was the eldest child in the family. Meena, Asha, Usha, and Hridaynath, in birth order, are her siblings; all are accomplished singers and musicians.[18]

She received her first music lesson from her father. At the age of five, she started to work as an actress in her father's musical plays (Sangeet Natak in Marathi). On her first day of school[17] she left because they would not allow her to bring her sister Asha with her.[19]
